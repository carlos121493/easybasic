10  ' This is the example shows how to create an infifte loop using for statement
20  ' This is Somewhat tricky but simple
30  for x = 1 to 10
40     print x
50     x=x-1 ' Here I decreased the value of x by 1 
60  next x ' Here the value of x is increased by 1
70 ' As First 1 is subtraced and then added to the value of 
80 ' x so the value of x remains same & loop will continues
